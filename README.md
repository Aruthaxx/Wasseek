Wa-Seek-Eye Follower mod

Wasseek-Ei is'nt like any other argonian you've met before having mostly grown up in Morrowind after the abolishment of slavery he feels more at home in the ash than the bitter cold of Skyrim he still has a love for swamps and swimming.

He came to Skyrim along with his brother Xaxheel after fleeing from Morrowind after being targeted by assassin's his brother has not revealed why to Wasseek perhaps you can discover the reason later on.  (You can find out more of his backstory as you become closer to him) .

Wasseek has some talent with bladed weapons such as knives, swords and daggers but can also cast basic magic like oakflesh and healing.

  Currently has full follower functionality.

  Not currently voice acted, as stated below low priority.

# Goals

   In future versions add a short quest to retrieve item for him to show you are trust worthy before recruitment.

   Eventually adding comments on Argonian culture in skyrim, quest comments, main questline, companions, college of winterhold, dark brotherhood and thieves guild, then dlc content dawnguard and dragonborn.

   Will look into adding newlands/quest mod support aslong as they are "follower friendly"

# Priorities

   voice acting is low priority as as long as the subtitles work adding voice lines to it is simple.

# V-1.0.0
   will be ready when quest and basic voice acting is finished
