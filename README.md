# Current Build
  
  Currently has full follower functionality.

  Not currently voice acted, as stated below low priority.


=======
# Goals

   In future versions add a short quest to retrieve item for him to show you are trust worthy before recruitment.

   Eventually adding comments on Argonian culture in skyrim, quest comments, main questline, companions, college of winterhold, dark brotherhood and thieves guild, then dlc content dawnguard and dragonborn.

   Will look into adding newlands/quest mod support aslong as they are "follower friendly"

# Priorities

   voice acting is low priority as as long as the subtitles work adding voice lines to it is simple.

# V-1.0.0
   will be ready when quest and basic voice acting is finished
